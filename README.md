This project results from two desires:
1) To improve my ability with the Django framework
2) To develop tools to aid in the pursuit of mindfulness

Mindfulness is a mental state which can broadly be described as non-judgemental awareness or attention.

Someone who is mindful is in the present moment, but not controlled or dictated by it.

It is a kind of autonomy.

The cultivation of mindfulness is said to have various mental and cognitive benefits.

One of the primary means of acquiring it is through meditation practice. Therefore a lot of tools provided through this site will be related to tracking meditation.
